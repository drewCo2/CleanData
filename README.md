## Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project

# Description
This repository contains two files.  
1. CodeBook.md - This describes the variables, data, and the data transformation in greater detail.  
2. run_analysis.R - This is the R script that imports, cleans, and merges the source data.  It also creates a tidy
   data set that can be used for further analysis.

# To Run
1. Excute the script run_analysis.R.  The script will automatically locate and download the appropriate data sets
   if they do not already exist on disk.
2. Upon completion, the script will output the tidy data to two files, TidyData.txt and TidyData.csv.  These files
   can used used and read into other programs for additional analysis and observation.
